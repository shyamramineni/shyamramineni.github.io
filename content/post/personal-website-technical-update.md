Today I was able to get this website up and running based on GitHub based workflow. 
I commit content markdown into GitHub, then I manually fire AWS codebuild. 
Build then picks up the source code of hugo project, runs Hugo, updates S3 bucket with static HTML. 

# Things TODO

1. Automate build based GitHub pull request
2. Figure out images
3. Organize content by Tags and Categories
4. Create pages
